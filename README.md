Deep estimation of the intensity and timing of selection from ancient genomes (Laval et al., BioRxiv 2023; https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.07.27.550703)

Code for simulating ancient DNA-related data and estimating selection parameters as proposed by Laval et al., BioRxiv 2023

Simulations:
Code for simulating ancient DNA samples as described in Laval et al., BioRxiv 2023 and previously described in Kerner et al., Cell Genomics 2023. 
Code was written in SLiM and uses a well-established European demography for the past 10,000 years. 

Estimation:
ABC and CNN estimation of selection strength (s) and time of onset of selection (T) are conducted using R
